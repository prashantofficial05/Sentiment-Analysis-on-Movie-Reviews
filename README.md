# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews
 **Introduction:**
 
 This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a sentiment analysis model using the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset. The 
 objective is to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral to gain insights into customer sentiments and improve decision-making 
 for movie marketing strategies.


**Goal:**
To analyze movie review data, identify sentiment patterns, and build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the sentiment of each review.

**Description:**
  The project utilizes movie review data to:

  - **Clean and Preprocess Text Data:** Remove unnecessary characters, and stopwords, and apply tokenization.
  - **Analyze Sentiment Distribution:** Understand the distribution of sentiments across the dataset.
  - **Build Sentiment Classification Model:** Train models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for sentiment prediction.
  - **Evaluate Model Performance:** Assess the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

     
**Skills:**
  - **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NLTK, sci-kit-learn)
  - **Data Visualization:** Python (Matplotlib, WordCloud)
  - **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

**Metrics:**
  - **Sentiment Distribution:** Percentage of positive, negative, and neutral reviews.
  - **Model Performance:** The classification models' accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - **Word Clouds:** Visual representation of frequently occurring words in positive and negative reviews.
**Summary:**
  The analysis revealed the sentiment distribution within movie reviews, helping identify the most frequent terms and their associations 
  with positive or negative sentiments. The sentiment classification models provided good accuracy, and Logistic Regression was found to 
  be the most effective model. Recommendations include utilizing sentiment analysis for movie marketing and improving strategies based on 
  audience feedback.

**Next Steps:**
  - **Improve Model Accuracy:** Experiment with more advanced NLP models like LSTM or BERT.
  - **Deploy the Model:** Build a web application using Flask for real-time sentiment analysis.
  - **Extend Analysis:** Incorporate other movie-related data such as genre, release year, and box office performance for more 
     comprehensive insights.
